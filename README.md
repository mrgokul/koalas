Koalas
======

Lightweight Data Analysis Framework. Inspired from R and Python-Pandas, and adapted to a terri*** language called Java. Use it only because you have no other choice.

Two major concepts:
*) DataFrame
*) Series

See here for the complete docs.

##DataFrame

Very similar to a Pandas/R DataFrame

### Getting Started

```java

DataFrame df = Koalas.readCSV("example.csv");
System.out.println(df);
/*



*/

```
